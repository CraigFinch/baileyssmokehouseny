      "I had been to Bailey’s several years ago, and the one thing I remembered was that the food was great. I brought my boyfriend here last night, for the first time, and let’s just say, he was not disappointed. We started with the MAC and cheese, pulled pork egg rolls, as an appetizer- . The spare ribs were by far the best ribs I’ve ever had. Pulled pork sandwich was great, my only suggestion would be putting it on a softer roll. Nonetheless, it was still very tasty. Our waitress was excellent- friendly, attentive and had great recommendations. All in all, if you want some good BBQ, go to Baileys!",

Having one of my children’s birthday parties in August at our house and going to get it catered by Bailey’s.",
